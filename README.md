# Code for: "interactive demo" from Trevor.io landing page

We built an interactive demo version of our platform (see it in action half-way down the page [here](https://trevor.io#demo)) so that visitors of our landing page can get a feel for what using our Query Builder is like without signing up.  

Feel free to fork this repo if you want to build your own interactive demo.

To run this demo on your own machine, clone/download this repo and run:

./start-on-mac.sh
